//TODO - Problem: Enum not separated into its own package.
// Why: Keeping enum definitions separate promotes better organization and can facilitate easier maintenance.
// What I offer: Move the TrainingType enum to a separate package for better code organization.
public enum TrainingType {
    STRENGTH_TRAINING, AEROBIC, BODYBUILDING, FLEXIBILITY_TRAINING, WEIGHTLIFTING
